As a BE developer, you’ve probably used JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users in APIs or microservices. But have you ever stopped to **decode** one and see what’s actually inside?

JWTs are more than just access tokens — they’re **self-contained information carriers** that hold user identity, claims, and security data. If you truly understand their structure, you’ll be able to:

Debug authentication issues quickly

Implement secure validation logic

Prevent token tampering or misuse

Build scalable, stateless APIs

In this post, we’ll dive deep into the **three core parts** of a JWT: **Header**, **Payload**, and **Signature** — and explore how they work together to make authentication both simple and powerful.

# What Is the Structure of a JWT?
A JWT is a **compact, URL-safe** string that consists of **three parts**, separated by dots (`.`):

```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```

Each part is **Base64Url encoded**, which means you can safely include it in URLs, HTTP headers, or cookies without issues.

Here’s what each segment represents:

- **Header** — Describes the token’s type and the algorithm used for signing.
- **Payload** — Contains the actual claims (user data, roles, expiration time, etc.).
- **Signature** — Verifies that the token hasn’t been tampered with.

Let’s break them down one by one.

## The Header — Token Type and Algorithm

The **Header** is a simple JSON object that defines metadata about the token.

A typical JWT header looks like this:
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```
- `alg`: The signing algorithm (e.g., HS256 for HMAC-SHA256, RS256 for RSA).
- `typ`: The token type — always `"JWT"`.

This part is then Base64Url encoded. For example, encoding the header above might give you something like:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
```

**Real-World Example**
Imagine your .NET API uses **HS256** (HMAC-SHA256) with a secret key to sign tokens for your users. The Header tells any recipient of the token exactly **how to verify** it — using HMAC and your shared secret.

If you later switch to **RS256** (public/private key), the Header will update accordingly, and the verification logic in your backend will adapt — **no need to store sessions** or extra metadata.

## The Payload — The Token’s Data (Claims)
The **Payload** is the heart of a JWT. It contains **claims** — pieces of information about the user or the token itself.

Example Payload:
```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Steve",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1728124800,
  "exp": 1728128400
}
```

Let’s break these down:
| Field   |      Description      | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| sub |  Subject — the unique identifier of the user. |
| name |    User’s name or username.   |
| role | Role or permission claim for authorization. |
| iat | Issued At — timestamp when token was created. |
| exp | Expiration — timestamp when token will expire. |

JWT claims can be three types:
- Registered claims — standardized fields (iss, sub, aud, exp, iat)
- Public claims — custom fields you define (name, role, etc.)
- Private claims — app-specific claims shared between parties

After Base64Url encoding, the Payload may look like this:
```
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlN0ZXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI4MTI0ODAwLCJleHAiOjE3MjgxMjg0MDB9
```

## The Signature — Ensuring Token Integrity

This is where the security magic happens.

The Signature ensures that the token hasn’t been altered since it was issued.

The formula is:
```
HMACSHA256(
    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
    base64UrlEncode(payload),
    secret)
```

If someone changes even one character in the Header or Payload, the Signature won’t match anymore, and the token will be rejected.

Example Signature (truncated):
```
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

In a API, when a request includes a JWT in the Authorization header like:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The framework (via JwtBearerHandler) automatically validates:

- The token’s **Signature** using the provided secret or public key
- The **expiration** time (exp)
- The **issuer** and **audience** if configured

If anything fails — boom 💥 — `401 Unauthorized`.

## Putting It All Together

Here’s what a full JWT looks like:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlN0ZXZlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI4MTI0ODAwLCJleHAiOjE3MjgxMjg0MDB9.
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

Even though it looks like gibberish, every part has meaning:

- First part (Header): Algorithm and Type
- Second part (Payload): User Claims
- Third part (Signature): Verification Seal

You can decode the first two parts using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) — just don’t share your secret key there!

# Summary

Understanding the anatomy of a JWT is essential for writing secure and **maintainable authentication logic** in API.

- The **Header** defines the token type and signing algorithm.
- The **Payload** carries the user data (claims).
- The **Signature** guarantees integrity and authenticity.
