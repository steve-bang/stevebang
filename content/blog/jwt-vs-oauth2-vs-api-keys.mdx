## Introduction

If you’ve been building APIs or web applications, you’ve likely come across terms like **JWT**, **OAuth2**, and **API Keys**. Each of these methods handles **authentication and authorization**, but they differ in complexity, use cases, and security level.

As developers, especially in the .NET world, understanding *which method suits your app best* can make or break your system’s security and scalability.

In this post, we’ll explore **the differences between JWT, OAuth2, and API Keys**, how they work, real-world examples, and guidance on choosing the right one for your project.

## 1. Quick Overview — What Are JWT, OAuth2, and API Keys?

| Method | Full Name | Primary Purpose | Typical Use Case |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **JWT (JSON Web Token)** | JSON Web Token | Token-based authentication and authorization | Web APIs, SPAs, mobile apps |
| **OAuth2** | Open Authorization 2.0 | Delegated access and third-party authorization | Login with Google, GitHub APIs |
| **API Key** | API Access Key | Simple authentication mechanism | Internal services, small APIs |

---

## 2. JWT (JSON Web Token)

JWT is a **self-contained token** used for securely transmitting information between parties. It’s composed of **three parts**: Header, Payload, and Signature.

A typical JWT looks like this:  
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjMiLCJyb2xlIjoiQWRtaW4ifQ.
H2mYlNQoDq8qytpGzE4yPcvFbWvEl1eYlZxvQG_oZgw
```

Each token is **digitally signed**, ensuring it can’t be tampered with.

### How It Works
1. User logs in with credentials.
2. Server validates credentials and generates a **JWT**.
3. Client stores the JWT (e.g., in localStorage or cookies).
4. On each request, client sends JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
5. Server verifies signature and decodes the payload to identify the user.

### Pros
- Stateless and scalable (no need to store sessions in DB).
- Fast validation.
- Works well with microservices and SPAs.

### Cons
- Tokens can’t be revoked easily before they expire.
- If stored insecurely, can be stolen (e.g., via XSS).

**Best for:** APIs and SPAs requiring fast, stateless authentication.

## 3. OAuth2

OAuth2 is **not just an authentication system**—it’s a **delegated authorization framework**. It’s widely used when you want to **grant third-party apps access to your data without sharing your password**.

### Real-World Example
When you “Sign in with Google” on a website, you’re using OAuth2.  
Google authorizes the site to access your profile data without giving them your Google password.

### How It Works
1. The user is redirected to the **OAuth provider** (like Google).
2. The user logs in and consents to share data.
3. The provider sends an **authorization code** to the app.
4. The app exchanges the code for an **access token** (and sometimes a refresh token).
5. The access token is used to call APIs.

### Pros
- Delegated access with granular permissions (Scopes).
- Supports refresh tokens.
- Very secure for third-party integrations.

### Cons
- Complex to implement correctly.
- Overkill for small internal APIs.

**Best for:** Third-party apps, large ecosystems, or when using social logins (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.).

---

## 4. API Keys

API Keys are the **simplest form of authentication**—a single secret token used to access an API.

Example:
```http
GET /api/data
Authorization: ApiKey 12345-abcde-67890
```

The server checks whether the key is valid and grants access.

### Pros
- Simple to use and implement.
- Great for internal services, scripts, or prototypes.

### Cons
- No user context (only identifies the calling app).
- Hard to revoke without affecting clients.
- Doesn’t support scopes or permissions easily.

**Best for:** Simple internal APIs or backend-to-backend services.

## 5. JWT vs OAuth2 vs API Keys — The Deep Comparison

| Feature | JWT | OAuth2 | API Key |
|----------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Authentication** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Authorization** | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| **Stateful or Stateless** | Stateless | Can be both | Stateless |
| **Supports Scopes/Roles** | Yes (custom claims) | Yes | No |
| **Token Expiration** | Yes | Yes | Optional |
| **Revocation Support** | Hard | Yes | Manual |
| **Ease of Implementation** | Moderate | Complex | Simple |
| **Ideal Use Case** | First-party apps & APIs | Third-party access | Internal APIs |

---

## 6. Choosing the Right Strategy

Let’s break it down by scenario.

### When to Use JWT
- You’re building a **.NET Web API** or **microservices** system.
- You want **stateless authentication** (no server session).
- You handle both authentication and authorization internally.

> Example: A React + .NET Web API app where the user logs in, gets a JWT, and uses it for all API requests.

### When to Use OAuth2
- You want to let users log in using **Google, Facebook, or Microsoft**.
- You need **fine-grained scopes** and **refresh tokens**.
- You’re building a **multi-tenant SaaS** that integrates with other platforms.

> Example: Your app allows “Login with GitHub” to fetch user repositories.

### When to Use API Keys
- You’re securing **internal APIs**, **cron jobs**, or **backend integrations**.
- Simplicity is more important than flexibility.

> Example: A background worker service calling your internal metrics API with a single shared API Key.

## 7. Combining Methods (Real-World Architecture)

In modern systems, it’s common to **combine** these methods:

- Use **OAuth2** for user authorization (delegated access).  
- Use **JWTs** to represent access tokens in your APIs.  
- Use **API Keys** for internal service-to-service communication.  

This hybrid approach gives you the **best of all worlds** — scalability, security, and flexibility.

---

## 8. Security Best Practices

No matter which method you choose:
- Always use **HTTPS**.
- Never store tokens in plain text or URLs.
- Implement **token expiration** and **rotation**.
- Prefer **short-lived access tokens** and **refresh tokens**.
- Regularly **rotate API Keys**.

---

## Conclusion

Choosing between **JWT, OAuth2, and API Keys** isn’t about which is “best” — it’s about what fits your app’s needs.

- For **modern web apps** → JWT  
- For **third-party integrations** → OAuth2  
- For **simple internal APIs** → API Keys  

By understanding the strengths and trade-offs of each, you can design a secure, scalable authentication system that fits your project perfectly.
