When developing web applications or APIs, exposing real (integer) IDs in URLs such as `/users/10` or `/products/25` can pose several risks:

- Users can easily guess other IDs.
- Vulnerable to enumeration attacks (ID guessing attacks).
- Unprofessional in terms of aesthetics or branding.

This is when HashId becomes a “savior” for developers.

# What is HashId?

In web API or ASP.NET application development, using sequential numeric IDs in URLs is common practice. However, this seemingly simple approach can introduce significant security risks and negatively impact user experience.

In this article, we’ll explore **HashId** — a solution that encodes numeric IDs into short, hard-to-guess strings—and show you how to implement HashId effectively in real-world .NET projects.


### 1. Vulnerable to IDOR Attacks (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

* Attackers can manually change the ID in the URL to access data that does not belong to them.
* Example: a user changes `/invoice/1001` → `/invoice/1002` to view someone else’s invoice.

> This is a serious security vulnerability, listed in the **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)**.

### 2. Internal Information Disclosure

* Exposes the number of records and growth rate (e.g., `/orders/1200`).
* Can be exploited for behavior analysis or by competitors.

### 3. Susceptible to Data Enumeration Attacks

* Hackers can automatically try `/users/1` to `/users/9999` to harvest data.

### 4. Unprofessional and Unfriendly URLs

* URLs like `/post/453` look “raw” and unrefined.
* Hard to remember and lack security.

# Solution: What is HashId?

**HashId** is an algorithm that encodes integers into short, random, non-sequential strings, which can be **decoded back on the server side**.

**Example**

| Real ID | HashId |
| ------- | ------ |
| 123     | 5vK9q  |
| 245     | m1nOp  |

→ `/users/123` → `/users/5vK9q`

---

# How to Use HashId in .NET

### 1. Install the Library

```bash
dotnet add package Hashids.net
```

### 2. Initialize in C# Code

```csharp
var hashids = new Hashids("your_salt_here", 6); // 6 is the minimum length
var encoded = hashids.Encode(123); // → "5vK9q"
var decoded = hashids.Decode(encoded); // → [123]
```

### 3. Real-World Usage in a Controller

```csharp
[HttpGet("{hashId}")]
public IActionResult GetUserByHash(string hashId)
{
    var hashids = new Hashids("your_salt", 6);
    var ids = hashids.Decode(hashId);
    if (ids.Length == 0) return NotFound();

    var user = _userService.GetById(ids[0]);
    if (user == null) return NotFound();

    return Ok(user);
}
```

## Comparing HashId with Other Solutions

### Using Sequential Numeric IDs (int, long)

* Advantages: Simple, high performance, small storage size (4–8 bytes).
* Disadvantages: Easy to guess, exposes data, not safe for public APIs.

### GUID/UUID

* Advantages: Globally unique, non-sequential, suitable when uniqueness across systems is required.
* Disadvantages: 
  - Very long string (36 characters)
  - Consumes more storage and index space when data is large.

### HashId

* Advantages: 
  - Shorter than GUID (5–10 characters)
  - Can be decoded on the server
  - More secure

* Disadvantages: Requires encode/decode handling; not globally unique like GUID.

| Solution  | Security Level | Length (chars) | DB Storage Size   |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `int`     | Low            | 1–10           | 4 bytes          |
| `GUID`    | High           | 36             | 16 bytes         |
| `HashId`  | Medium         | 6–10           | ~10–12 bytes     |

### Storage & Performance with Large Data

- Integer IDs: lightest, but easiest to enumerate.
- GUID:
    - Increases index size in the database → slows down queries on large tables (millions of records).
    - Consumes more storage space → impacts overall performance.

- HashId:
    - No extra storage needed, still stores integers but handles hashID in the backend.
    - Smaller than GUID → more optimal for large tables queried by ID.
    - Can create indexes, but should be tested with large datasets.


For systems that require public IDs, moderate security, and want to maintain good performance at scale, HashId offers a balanced solution between security and storage efficiency.

# Relation to OWASP and Security

Exposing real IDs in URLs is one of the main causes of **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)** vulnerabilities—a critical issue ranked highly in the **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)**.

> While HashId does not replace proper authorization checks, it acts as a **first layer of defense**, enhancing security and slowing down automated attacks.

# Notes When Using HashId

* Always use a unique `salt` for each application to prevent easy decoding.
* HashId is not a high-security encryption method (like AES); it is only suitable for **anonymizing displayed IDs**.
* Do not use HashId for sensitive information unless combined with additional encryption layers.

---

# Conclusion

Using **HashId in .NET** is a simple yet highly effective approach to:

* Enhance security,
* Improve user experience,
* And make your system more professional.

If you are developing a Web API or ASP.NET application, consider integrating HashId today.
